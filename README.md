# Judaism Online

This project provides a simple web application for free blog posts, courses and informational pages about Judaism.
It uses the local Llama 3 model (via [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)) to automatically generate content.

## Features

- Daily blog posts generated by AI (two posts per run of `daily_post.py`).
- Admin interface to create new blog posts and courses on demand and edit page content.
- Courses include difficulty levels and prerequisites.
- Printable certificate page after completing a course.
- News section populated from the JTA API (`update_news.py`).

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Ensure an Ollama instance is running locally with the `llama3:8b` model.
3. Run the web app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. (Optional) Generate two daily blog posts from the command line:
   ```bash
   python daily_post.py
   ```
5. (Optional) Fetch the latest news items:
   ```bash
   python update_news.py
   ```

The application uses a SQLite database (`site.db`) created automatically on first run.

Placeholder images used by the templates can be replaced in `static/`:

- `hero.jpg`
- `about.jpg`
- `contact.jpg`
- `faq.jpg`
- `news.jpg`

Set the admin password using the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable (defaults to `admin`).

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

You can generate a static version of the site using Frozen-Flask:

```bash
python freeze.py
```

The script initializes the database tables if needed and then writes the
generated HTML to the `docs/` directory.

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`) automatically
freezes the site on every push to `main` and publishes the contents of `docs/`
to the `gh-pages` branch. Enable GitHub Pages for that branch in the repository
settings so the static site is available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`.
